# CARS RENTAL

The system has a Car list, for which it must be realized:
- choice by a brand;
- choice by quality class;
- sorting by hire cost;
- sorting by name.

A client registers in the system, chooses a car and makes a rental order.
An unregistered client cannot make an order. In the order data a client indicates passport data,
option 'with a driver'/'without a driver', rental period. The system creates an Invoice, which is paid by a client.

A manager treats the order and can deny it, indicating the reason.
A manager also registers a return of the car, in case of the car damage creates a bill
for repair through the system.

A system administrator has rights of:
- adding, deleting of cars, editing of the information about the cars;
- blocking/unblocking of users;
- registration of managers in the system.
